Wisps

There are 6 different types of wisps in the game, each with different effects. All wisps look like puffs of their element, with white eyes, and they cannot fall off of edges. There are 2 different movements that any wisp can have. There is staying still, where the wisp will not move, but most likely be in a very crucial part of the path. Wisps that don't move will always face the player. There is also moving, which will have the wisp moving in a pattern, sometimes slowly, and sometimes fast. The 6 types of wisps all move like this, but do different things when contact is made with them. Certain characters have immunities to certain wisps.
 - Poison Wisps
    Poison wisps are green, with green poison particles comming off of them. When contact is made with one of them, they will evaporate, and the screen will become very hard to understand. The view of the screen is duplicated 4 times, so that you see 5 of everything, in a plus sign pattern. This will make it very easy for the player to fall of the edge. The effect will last for quite a few seconds.
    Immune Characters
    Panic Bot is immune to poison wisps, the wisp will hit the Panic Bot, but then just evaporate, and take no effect.
 - Blindness Wisps
    Blindness wisps are purple, with purple magic particles comming off of them. When contact is made with one of them, they will evaporate, and the screen will be surrounded in purple smoak, limiting the players view to only a few blocks in every direction. The player will then have a hard time seeing things that are further away. This will make it very easy for the player to die from a long ranged trap. The effect will last for quite a few seconds.
    Immune Characters
    None
 - Confusion Wisps
    Confusion wisps are gold, with gold star-like particles comming off of them. When contact is made with one of them, they will evaporate, and the character will have 7 stars rotating around his head. While there are any stars above the players head, the players controls will be inverted. Right is left, left is right, up is down, and down is up. 1 star will disapear every 1 to 2 seconds or so. The controls will immediately go back to normal when all the stars are gone. While the controls are inverted, it is very easy for the player to die from trying to dodge something, or falling off a narrow path.
    Immune Characters 
    None
 - Ice Wisps
    Ice wisps are white, with snowflake particles comming off of them. When contact is made with one of them, they will evaporate, and the character will be frozen in a block of ice. The character will then need to move five times. It does not matter which direction the player moves each time, it just matters the movement was attempted. While frozen, the player can be hit by any trap, and cannot dodge it. The effect will last until the player has broken out. 
    Immune Characters
    Rik is immune to ice wisps, the wisp will hit Rik, but then just evaporate, and take no effect.
 - Electric Wisps
    Electric wisps are dark blue with a light blue outline, with lightning particles zapping amoung the wisp. When contact is made with one of them, they will evaportate, and electricute the player, killing them.
    Immune Characters
    Panic Bot is immune to electric wisps, the wisp will hit Panic Bot, but then just recharge some of the Panic Bots battery.
 - Fire Wisps 
    Fire wisps are orange with flame particles burning amoung the wisp. When contact is made with one of them, they will evaporate, and burn the player, killing them.
    Immune Characters
    Rik is immune to fire wisps, the wisp will hit Rik, but then just charge up the fire shield by 1 fireball.
